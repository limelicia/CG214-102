            <p><mark>Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan</mark> was also known as <b>Wat Arun</b>, or the <span style="color:orange">"Temple of Dawn"</span>. It is a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thailand. The temple got its name from the Hindu god, <i>Aruna</i>, who represents the rising sun. It is one of Thailand's famous landmarks. The first ray of light from the morning Sun reflects off the temple's surface, giving it a pearly iridescence appearance. Wat Arun can be recognised by its distinctive prang, which was built in the early nineteenth century.</p>
